CITIZENS GAVE
NEGRO A TRIAL
He Confessed Committing Assault
and Was Given the
Rope Sentence
Dyersburg, Tenn., February 18.- Freder
ick King, a negro, charged with a murderous
assault upon Miss Elsie Arnold,
the daughter of a prominent physician,
was lynched by a mob of citizens short
ly after noon today. The summary execution
of the negro was orderly and unattended
by any acts of fiendishness.
King, after being tracked by blood
hounds, was arrested and this morning
he was given a trial before twelve prominent
citizens. After testifying in his own
behalf the negro finally confessed his
guilt and implicated Bee Montgomery,
another negro. King was taken by a mob
to a tree near the courthouse and with
out ceremony was strung up. Rumors
were rife that several negroes had been
lynched, but these statements are with
out foundation. Montgomery, who was
implicated by King, has been arrested,
and is in the city jail.
A dramatic incident of the mock trial
was the prayer of Rev. McCauley, pastor
of the colored Presbyteran church in this
city. In fervent words he pleaded for
God's mercy on the doomed man amidst
the most impressive silence
Everything is quiet and orderly. tonight.
