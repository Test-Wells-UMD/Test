HOW NOW, DELAWARE
Public Sentiment Generally
Approves the Lynching.
Will the Authorities Take Action Locking To
ward the Arrest and Punishment of
the Leaders?
( By the Associated Press.)
Wilmington, Del., June 23.- The natural
and interesting question today is whether
the authorities will take action looking
toward the arrest and punishment of those
who were prominent in the lynching of
George White early this morning. That
many of them are known cannot be doubted
for they were seen by the thousands
who witnessed the affair. It is also known
that the arrangements for the lynching
were talked of in advance, and that
men were invited to participate and given
notice of when and where to assemble. It
was this fact that gave publicity to the
lynching for the news that it was to
occur last night was circulated around
Wilmington yesterday with the result
that thousands who went out last night
did so with the knowledge that the af
fair would come off according to
ments. arrange
It is fact that public sentiment so generally
approves the lynching that it would
be hard to secure the conviction of a
lyncher even if arrests are made, which
seems doubtful.
During the day thousands of persons
went to the scene of the lynching, many
of them intent upon securing ghastly
relics. In this, however, they met with
little success, as the burning had been so
effectual as to destroy every vestige
of the victim's body almost. The only re-
mains were pieces of his bones.
In order to reach the scene many of
these people walked the three miles from
Wilmington in a drizzling rain, and those
who rode on the trolley cars had to walk
a mile before they reached the spot.
But nothing could abate their ardor, and
all day there was a constant stream of
people travelling along the road.
Judge Grubb, of the county court, today
made a public statement in which he deplores
the lynching of White and its consequent
reflection upon the go name of
Delaware. Judge Grubb also explained the
action of the court in refusing to call a
special session of the grand jury for the
indictment of Miss Bishop's murderer. He
says the trial would have been attended
by such public clamor and prejudice that
a fair trial would have been impossible
and the court would have been compelled
to grant the motion of the prisoner's
counsel for a change of venue. Once the
prisoner was moved to the insecure jail
of Kent county or Sussex county he might
have escaped.
At the county work- house today every
thing was quiet. Warden Meserve with
his guards was on duty and had hundreds
of callers to whom they refused admittance
. The large double doors at the
main entrance have been carried away
entirely and not a vestige remains.
Nearly all the clergymen in the city
held a meeting today and passed resolutions
saying:
" We put on record our sense of sorrow,
indignation and shame at the lawlessness
and anarchistic demonstration that has
brought reproach upon our common
wealth"; and insisting upon the sanctity
of the law and necessity for confiding
in the integrity the of our courts of justice
