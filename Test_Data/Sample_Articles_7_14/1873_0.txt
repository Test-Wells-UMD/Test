HIS MAN BE
LYNCHED.
Sermon by Rev. Robert El

Delaware.
The Citizens of the State Should Arise in Their
Might Execute the Criminal and Thus
Uphold the Majesty of
the Law.
( By the Associated Press.)
Wilmington, Del., June 23.- Rev. Robt.
A. Elwood, pastor of the Olivet Presbyterian
Church, preached a sensational ser
mon on the probable lynching of White
last Sunday evening. He took his text
from Corinthians V., 13:" Therefore, put
away from among ourselves that wicked
person."
After referring to the delay in bringing
White to a trial, Mr. Elwood said:
" Should the murderer of Miss Bishop
be lynched? Yes, but only under one condition
and that is this: If his trial shall
,
be delayed until September and then,
though he be proven guilty, through some
technicality of the law or any rule undue
influence upon either judges or jury he be
not given capital punishment, then the
citizens of the State should arise in their
might and execute the criminal and thus
uphol dthe majesty of the law."
Mr. Elwood said today:
" I am very sorry it happened as it did.
gal trial; but I also should have had a le.
gal trial; but I also believe that he should
have had a speedy trial. The lesson we
can learn from last
night's outbreak is
that the people are tired of the delays
of the law, Certain terrible crimes re
quire stern and speedy punishment, and
when the machinery of the law is not set
in motion the people, impatient of
delay move themselves." the
