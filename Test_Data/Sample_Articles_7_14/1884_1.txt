IT WAS MURDER.
From the Montgomery Advertiser.
That mob law begets mob law is well
illustrated by the scenes in the eastern
part of Elmore last Tuesday.

There was no use for the lynching of the
negro victim of that gang of lawless
white men, and every one engaged in it
ought to be indicted and punished to the
extent of the law. There was no assault
in this case on a white woman. The offcers
of the county, it seems, were not
aware of any trouble or the disgraceful
murder might have been prevented. The
negro, however, was taken from a num
ber of citizens who were conveying him to
jail. There was, therefore, no danger of
escaping, and, as he was practically in
the hands of the law, his trial at an early
date was assured. A great crime against
the dignity and honor of Alabama
been committed. has
