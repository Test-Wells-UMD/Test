The Governor Much Distressed.
( By the Associated Press.)
Dover, Del., June 23.- Governor Hunn
appeared greatly distressed today over the
lynching of the negro White. When
pressed for a statement he said:
" There is nothing to say now. Let the
people become calm once more and reflect
upon what has been done in a great frenzy
of excitement. I shall confer with the
Attorney General to see what course we
can take."
It was learned today that the Governor
received a telegram at 11:30 o'clock ist
night from J. Newlin
Gawthrop president
of the trustees of
,
the New Castle
county workhouse, and David J. Reinhardt
, solicitor of the city of Wilming-
ton. It read as follows:
" Call militia out at once to protect
workhouse property. Already entered by
mob of 2,000."
I twas then too late for the Governor
to take such action as the troops could
not have reached the scene in time
prevent the lynching. to
