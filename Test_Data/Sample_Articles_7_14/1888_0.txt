MORE LYNCHERS IN JAIL.
To- Day There Will be a Sermon at
Huntsville Against Mobs.
( By the Associated Press.)
Huntsville, Ala., Sept. 17.- Silas
Worley, a teamster and Josh H. Mitchell
, a peddler, were lodged in jail
alleged connection with
to- day for
the lynching of Horace Maples. Wor
ley is charged with arson and Mitchell
with murder. There is a rumor that
additional troops have been ordered
here to guard the jail, but Captain
Lucian Brown, in charge of the
militia, authorizes a denial of all
such rumors.
The city of Huntsville has resumed
its peaceful aspect and there are now
no signs of disturbances. Reports of
organized mobs from various localities
formed to liberate alleged lynch
ers have proved groundless. Worley
and Mitchell who were arrested to
day will not be arraigned in court
until Monday, because the jury box
has been exhausted. Higgins was
marched from the jail to the court
house with a single deputy as escort,
and many of his friends shook hands
with him. To- a. preacher
will deliver a sermon morrow against mobs.
