Lynchers to the Bar.
The lynching of the negro, Robert
White, in Elmore County, and the murder
of an innocent negro in this coun-
ty, near Leeds, in connection with the
Jim Brown case, are two cases that
call for action on the part of the authorities
of both State and county. If
these crimes go unpunished, and especially
if no effort is made to bring the
guilty men to trial, liberty of action is
given to the lawless hereafter, and no
limit can be named.
In the Elmore case a quarrel had
arisen over some chickens, and
harm would have come to any one no
if a mob of ten men had not seized one
of the negroes involved in it. In the
Jefferson County case an innocent but
scared negro was shot down, and no
arrest followed. Of the two it is difficult
to say which is the worse. Certainly
Jefferson is in no position to
cast stones at Elmore- and few other
countles are.
Shall these lawless and bloody acts
against an inferior race go on unpunished
? Where and to what do they
lead? Whom do they brutalize? What
is the teaching of history in relation
to such acts? These and like questions
are coming up for answer, and they
deserve consideration at once; and it
is matter of general congratulation
that the authorities and the good peo
ple of Wetumpka are determined that
the Elmore wrong shall be righted to
the of bringing the ten men en
gaged extent in it to trial.
