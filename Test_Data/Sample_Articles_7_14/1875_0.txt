BAD NEGRO LYNCHED.
He Tried to Poison White People and was Dis
covered.
Correspondence of the Gazette.
LINDEN, TEX., July 25.- George
Lewis, colored, lost his life at the hands
of an infuriated mob the 16th inst., in
the northern portion of this county.
The eircumstances, as learned by your
reporter to- day, are as follows: Some
time last week he made a partially sue
cessful attempt to poison a white man by
the name of Shaw by placing strychnine
in the water bucket. Shaw
was made seriously ill for
two days but finally recovered.
Lewis, failing in this effort, employed a
half- wittted negro to put strychnine in
lemonade that was being sold at a picnic
given by white people, telling him to
poison everything on the hill .. The
strychnia was discovered before used and
the whole plot revealed. That night
Lewis was visited by a masked throng
and left dangling between earth and
heaven as an unfit subject for
place. either
