THREATS OF MOB VIOLENCE
Citizens of Springfield Go to Charles

Jim Brown Who Outraged
Miss Garrett.
---
Jim Brown, the negro who outraged 18
year- old Miss Garrett, near Springville,
St. Clair County, about a month ago, has
been captured in Charleston, S. C., or at
least the officers there have a negro man
in custody who answers to his description
. Three men from Springville are now
on their way to Charleston to identify
him.
Yesterday morning a telegram was received
in Springville from a lawyer of
Charleston asking if a reward had been
offered for the apprehension of Brown,
and if so, what amount. The reply went
immediately that the citizens had raised
a fund of$ 350 for that purpose and that
the Governor of Alabama had supplemented
this with additional reward to be
paid by the State an.
Not long afterwards another telegram
came from the Charleston lawyer stating
that Brown was there and that he could
be had on the payment of the rewards
mentioned, and suggested that officers
be sent at once with certified checks for
the amount of the citizens' reward and
that on the delivery of this check the ne
gro would be turned over to them.
Last night Mr. Manley, Boary Forman
and Tom Jones, all of Springville, the lat
ter the postmaster, arrived in Birmingham
en route for Charleston, for which
city they will leave on the Southern train
at 6 o'clock this morning. They knew
Brown and if the negro in custody at
Charleston is he, they will be able to
identify him.
The crime with which Brown is
charged was committed near Springville
about a month ago. Miss Garrett, an
18- year- old girl, while walking along the
road was attacked by Brown who
dragged her some distance into the woods
where he detained her for several hours.
After the accomplishment of his foul
purpose he left and shortly thereafter
Miss Garrett returned to her home and
related the horrible details of the
crime.
The male population of the entire community
turned out and for several days
scoured the country between Birmingham
and Springville and in other directions
for him, but finally abandoned their
search as they could find no trace of the
much wanted man.
The news that a negro answering to the
description of Jim Brown had been ar
rested in Charleston rapidly spread over
the country around Springville yester
day and it is stated that plans have
already been formed for the speedy execution
of the negro if he proves to be
the right one. The excitement growing
out of the commission of the crime had
never entirely died out and the news of
the apprehension of the criminal intensified
the feeling has all along pre
vailed. that
