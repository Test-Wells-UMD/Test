PORTER CONFESSED.
Negro Boy Admits He Killed Louise
Frost.
Denver, Col., November 15.- After with
standing the pressure of the sweatbox at
the city jail for four days, John Porter, the
16- year- old negro, who was arrested Sun
day, charged with the murder of Louise
Frost, 11 years of age, has broke down
and confessed every detail of the hideous
crime. The little girl was the daughter
of a ranchman living four miles from
Limon, and attended school in town, driv
ing back and forth. On Wednesday last,
while on her way home, she was waylaid,
assaulted and murdered, her body showing
no less than fourteen knife wounds.
On Saturday Preston Porter, colored, and
his two sons, Arthur and John, who had
been working on the railroad near Limon,
were arrested en route to their home in
and John Porter
Lawrence, Kan., was
charged with the crime. Only circumstantial
evidence was brought against him and
he told a straight story, adhearing to it so
tenaciously as almost to convince the officers
of his innocence. Tonight, however,
he weakened. The police department sent
two men to Limon to verify some
of his statements. They wish to be absolutely
sure of his guilt before giving him
up, owing to a strong belief that he will
be lyncned on his arrivai at Limon.
Porter's confession has been confirmed by
the finding of the girl's pocketbook near
the Limon depot, where Porter admitted
he threw it. A dozen citizens of Limon
started for Denver today with the avowed
purpose of acting as an escort for Sheriff
Freeman and his prisoner on their journey
to the jail at Hugo. Five hundred deter
mined men, most of them ranchmen, have
assembled at Limon and Hugo, and they
make no secret of their intention to lynch
Porter.
District Attorney McAllister refused this
morning to an order for the removal
of John Porter issue.
