She Defied Him and Died.
( By the Associated Press.)
Wilmington, Del., June 23.- All is quiet
in this community today following the
horrible lynching of George White, Helen
Bishop's confessed slayer at an early
hour this morning. Of the mob of nearly
five thousand overpowered the au-
thorities, stormed that the Ne wCastle county
workhouse and dragged from a cell the
trebling wretch and burned him at the
stake, the identity of only one is publicly
known. That person is little Peter Smith,
twelve- years- old, who fell when the work
house guards fired a volley into the ranks
of the attacking mob. The lad was struck
by a bullet, which entered his back and
is thought to have penetrated. his kidneys.
At the Homeopathic Hospital, where the
injured boy was immediately taken, the
physicians stated that he is in a serious
condition.
White's confession, made just before the
tortch was applied to the pile of oil- soaked
bushes around him, was an admission of
everything and more than had been
charged against him. He is stated to have
said:
" I was sent by Mr. Woodward to the
corn- field to try some corn. I saw Mr.
Woodward's daughter and intended to assault
her, but a couple of men came along
in a wagon and I did not disturb her.
Then I saw the Bishop girl and I followed
her. I seized her and asked her if she had
any money she would give me to let her
go. She gave me sixty cents. Then I
again seized her and she cried:'
don't hurt me. Please
" I choked her and accomplished my purpose
. Then I asked her if she was going
to tell on me. She said she was. I gave
her a hack in the throat with my knife
and asked again if she was going to in
form on me. She said she was, and then
I cut her throat twice again and left her.
After that I went back to Mr. Woodward
and told him there was no good water to
drink down there and he sent me somewhere
else.
I went back once but soon
left. Then I went back to the house and
put on a white hat instead of the cap that
I wore.
You would not do this if I wasi
a white man and did that."
The leader was a man who said his name
was Baker, and that he was from Virginia
. His face was familiar to most of
the people and it is believed he is a resident
of Wilmington, although some say
he had been imported for the purpose of
leading the mob.
The lynching is believed to have been
the result of a plot which was concocted
several days ago and was to have been
put into execution Saturday night, but on
occasion there was misunderstanding
that and the attempt failed.
