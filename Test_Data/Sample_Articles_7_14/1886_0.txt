BY E. E. KERSH.
Age- Herald Bureau, Clancey's Hotel,
Montgomery, July 9 .-( Special.)- Governor
Jelks has determined to use his every ef
fort to suppress lynchings in Alabama,
and with this end in view he today offered
a reward of$ 200 each for the arrest and
conviction of persons who participated in
the lawless hanging of a negro in Elmore
County last week.
It will be recalled that Robert White,
colored, was lynched in Elmore County on
July 2 by a mob of" unknown" citizens.
White had been charged with an assaul
with a weapon upon a white man residing
near Tallessee, claiming that the
white man had slaughtered the former's
chickens while in the latter's yard. The
case has attracted widespread attention
lawlessness universally con
and the
demned.
Governor Jelks has been investigating
the matter, with the result that he today
issued the following proclamation of re
ward
Whereas:, Robert White, a helpless citi
zen of this State, in charge of a peace
officer and on his way to a jail of detention
, was foully set upon and murdered
by a mob of unknown persons in Elmore
County on the 2nd day of July, 1901, dis
gracing the State, bringing discredit and
dishonor upon the fair name of justice
outraging all good people- a crime
and
for which there was no possible excuse,
the prisoner himself not being charged
with a capital offense.
Now, therefore, I, William D. Jelks,
Governor of Alabama, by virtue of the
authority in me vested, do issue this proclamation
, offering a reward of two hundred
dollars for evidence which will se
secure the final conviction of each one of
the persons who engaged in this assault
upon the peace and dignity of the State
of Alabama, costing this helpless prisoner
his life and all law- abiding citizens annoyance
and shame; provided that the to
tal reward for the conviction of any num
ber of those engaged shall not exceed
eight hundred dollars.
Done at the Capitol, in the city of Montgomery
, this the 9th day of July, 1901.
JELKS.
