lynching at Wetumpka last night. Zeb

ed assault upon Miss Pierson, one of the
most popular young ladies residing near

executed. So quietly was it managed
that not three persons in Wetumpka knew
that a lynching was in progress.
Zeb Floyd, the negro prisoner, was ar
rested near Elictric Saturday. His offense
was a most serious one. He was accused
of entering the room of a young lady with
a most dastardly purpose.
The crime was committed Friday night.
The scene was the home of Mr. J. P.
Pierson,
living near Electric, fourteen
miles from Wetumpka. A daughter of Mr.
Pierson, a young lady held in the highest
esteem, was awakened by a grasp upon her
arm. A burly negro was at her bedside.
She screamed, and the brute ran from the
house.
He was gone before Mr. Pierson could
get to him.
The negro was seen by Mr. Pierson as he
disappeared through the window.
His tracks mute, yet eloquent evidence
against the intruder, led to and from the
house.
The Negro Arrested
Zeb Floyd, a negro living in the neighborhood
, was arrested and carried to We

lynching. It appeared that he would be
given a trial before the law. At Electric,
however, the feeling was intense.
At midnight last night the county jailor
at Wetumpka was aroused. In the darkness
he saw three men. The man in the center
was securely bound.
The other two explained that he was a
prisoner from the upper part of the county.
They showed a mittimus regularly made
out, which purported to be from a justice
of the peace, Mr. J. P. Edwards. It is said
to have been a forgery.
The jailor unlocked the great steel door.
The fake prisoner was led in by his guards.
At that instant nine or ten others rushed
from the darkness into the jail. The bonds
of the willing prisoner were quickly cut.
Zeb Floyd, half asleep, was hurried
the jail. from
Not a sound had disturbed a citizen of
Wetumpka. Silently the party had come
into town. As silently they rode out. But
there was one with them who had not rid
den in with the party.
Jailor Chase immediately ran over to the
home of Sheriff Robbins. The sheriff was
aroused, but the avenging party had by that
time left the town behind them.

Sheriff Robbins this morning early fol
lowed the trail of the men. At Cain Creek
the lifeless body of Zeb Floyd was found
hanging to a tree, two miles from town.
There was no mark of violence on the body.

placard:

who perpetrate his crime will meet
his punishment."
The entrance was made into the young
ladies' room. In the room were Miss Katie
Pierson, aged 19, and a younger sister 16.
Miss Kate was awakened by a hand upon
her person. She thought it was a cat, but
