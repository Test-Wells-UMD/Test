## Meet the penguins

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/main/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/lter_penguins.png){style="float:right;" fig-alt="Illustration of three species of Palmer Archipelago penguins: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie. Artwork by @allison_horst." width="401"}

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

#|   A scatterplot of penguins bill depth and length, colored by
#|   species of penguins. There is a relatively strong, linear association.
#| fig-cap: |

# Labelling figures
In the code block in which a graph is created or called, you can add options such as labels (#| label: ) and captions (#| fig-cap: )
Both will be displayed underneath the graph.

Pictures can also get a label: {#fig-label}

The labels can be used for in-text references with @fig-label


# Arranging pictures
Pictures can still be inserted using:
![Caption](file.png)

Several pictures can be arranged more easily using layout-ncol or layout-nrow - for example:
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Caption](file1.png)
![Caption](file2.png)


# Callout blocks

The five callout blocks:
- note
- tip
- warning
- caution
- important

Callout blocks are framed by :::{callout-TypeOfCallout} and :::

# Preparation

## Choosing the data

As everyone always says,

> penguins are very cute!

...so let's work with penguin data today.  

:::{.callout-note}
Note that the palmerpenguins dataset is meant as an alternative to the commonly used iris data.
:::

More information on this data set is available on [Allison Horst's Github page.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)  


:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand to learn more about where the data was collected
Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.
:::


This data can also be used via the {palmerpenguins} package [@Horst.2020] and was originally introduced in @Gorman.2014  


## Loading packages & reading data

First, we need to:  
1. load **packages**  
2. read in **data**  
3. check if that data is *in the right format*  

[By "right format", we mean that the data is tidy, and ready to be summarised and graphed.]{.aside}

:::{.callout-tip}
## Using the data without downloading it
This same dataset is also available in the package palmerpenguins.
:::

```{r library and data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
penguins <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-28/penguins.csv') %>% 
  drop_na()
head(penguins)
```

We've removed missing values here, which means that the data has `r nrow(penguins)` rows now[^1].


## Some descriptive statistics

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Penguin species drawing by Allison Horst](penguin_species.png){#fig-penguins}

![Explaining bill dimensions](culmen_depth.png){#fig-bill}
:::


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
The average bill length is `r mean(penguins$bill_length_mm)` mm and the average bill depth is `r mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm)` mm.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
The data was collected between `r min(penguins$year)` and `r max(penguins$year)`.
:::

::::


### Comparing base R and tidyverse syntax

Here's code to see data in a specific column:

::: {.panel-tabset}
#### base R
``` {.r}
penguins$bill_length_mm
```

#### tidyverse
``` {.r}
penguins %>% select(bill_length_mm)
```

:::


# Graphs

Some ideas for graphs:

* penguin weight by flipper length  
    + for the entire data  
    + or separately for each species  
    + and additionally by sex  
* flipper and bill length  
* bill length and depth  

## Weight and flipper length

The following graphs are slightly simplified versions from the [vignette for the {palmerpenguins} package.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html)


### Entire data
```{r}
#| label: fig-entire
#| fig-cap: Penguin flipper length and body mass
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)") +
  theme_minimal()

mass_flipper
```

Refer to @fig-bill for an explanation of the measurements.

### Separated by species
```{r}
#| label: fig-species
#| fig-cap: Penguin flipper length and body mass, separately by species
mass_flipper_species <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species,
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal()

mass_flipper_species
```

@fig-entire does not separate the data by species, while @fig-species does.

### Separated by species and sex
```{r}
#| label: fig-sex
#| fig-cap: Penguin flipper length and body mass, separately by species and sex
#| cap-location: margin
mass_flipper_species +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

[^1]: Note that this removes any rows with missing values!
